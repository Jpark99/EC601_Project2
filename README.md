EC601 Project2

Say you are scraping data based on locations. Almost every single time, you'd need coordinates or geocode of the locations.
This porject is aimed for this specific use case.
The user can input two coordinates and it will create a box, then return a list of popular locations in that region, in coordinates. 
The user can reduce the time it takes for them to scrape coordinates.

To use this, simply download the code, and get your Google Maps Api Keys and paste it into the specified section.
